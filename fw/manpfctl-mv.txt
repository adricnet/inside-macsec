     The ppffccttll utility communicates with the packet filter device.  It allows
     ruleset and parameter configuration and retrieval of status information
     from the packet filter.

     Packet filtering restricts the types of packets that pass through network
     interfaces entering or leaving the host based on filter rules as
     described in pf.conf(5).  The packet filter can also replace addresses
     and ports of packets.  Replacing source addresses and ports of outgoing
     packets is called NAT (Network Address Translation) and is used to con-
     nect an internal network (usually reserved address space) to an external
     one (the Internet) by making all connections to external hosts appear to
     come from the gateway.  Replacing destination addresses and ports of
     incoming packets is used to redirect connections to different hosts
     and/or ports.  A combination of both translations, bidirectional NAT, is
     also supported.  Translation rules are described in pf.conf(5).

     The packet filter does not itself forward packets between interfaces.
     Forwarding can be enabled by setting the sysctl(8) variables
     _n_e_t_._i_n_e_t_._i_p_._f_o_r_w_a_r_d_i_n_g and/or _n_e_t_._i_n_e_t_6_._i_p_6_._f_o_r_w_a_r_d_i_n_g to 1.  Set them
     permanently in sysctl.conf(5).

     The ppffccttll utility provides several commands.  The options are as follows:

     --AA      Load only the queue rules present in the rule file.  Other rules
             and options are ignored.

     --aa _a_n_c_h_o_r
             Apply flags --ff, --FF, and --ss only to the rules in the specified
             _a_n_c_h_o_r.  In addition to the main ruleset, ppffccttll can load and
             manipulate additional rulesets by name, called anchors.  The main
             ruleset is the default anchor.

             Anchors are referenced by name and may be nested, with the vari-
             ous components of the anchor path separated by `/' characters,
             similar to how file system hierarchies are laid out.  The last
             component of the anchor path is where ruleset operations are per-
             formed.

             Evaluation of _a_n_c_h_o_r rules from the main ruleset is described in
             pf.conf(5).

             Private tables can also be put inside anchors, either by having
             table statements in the pf.conf(5) file that is loaded in the
             anchor, or by using regular table commands, as in:

                   # pfctl -a foo/bar -t mytable -T add 1.2.3.4 5.6.7.8

             When a rule referring to a table is loaded in an anchor, the rule
             will use the private table if one is defined, and then fall back
             to the table defined in the main ruleset, if there is one.  This
             is similar to C rules for variable scope.  It is possible to cre-
             ate distinct tables with the same name in the global ruleset and
             in an anchor, but this is often bad design and a warning will be
             issued in that case.

             By default, recursive inline printing of anchors applies only to
             unnamed anchors specified inline in the ruleset.  If the anchor
             name is terminated with a `*' character, the --ss flag will recur-
             sively print all anchors in a brace delimited block.  For example
             the following will print the ``authpf'' ruleset recursively:

                   # pfctl -a 'authpf/*' -sr

             To print the main ruleset recursively, specify only `*' as the
             anchor name:

                   # pfctl -a '*' -sr

     --DD _m_a_c_r_o=_v_a_l_u_e
             Define _m_a_c_r_o to be set to _v_a_l_u_e on the command line.  Overrides
             the definition of _m_a_c_r_o in the ruleset.

     --dd      Disable the packet filter.

     --XX _t_o_k_e_n
             Release the pf enable reference represented by the token passed.

     --ee      Enable the packet filter.

     --EE      Enable the packet filter and increment the pf enable reference
             count.

     --FF _m_o_d_i_f_i_e_r
             Flush the filter parameters specified by _m_o_d_i_f_i_e_r (may be abbre-
             viated):

             --FF nnaatt        Flush the NAT rules.
             --FF qquueeuuee      Flush the queue rules.
             --FF rruulleess      Flush the filter rules.
             --FF ssttaatteess     Flush the state table (NAT and filter).
             --FF SSoouurrcceess    Flush the source tracking table.
             --FF iinnffoo       Flush the filter information (statistics that are
                           not bound to rules).
             --FF TTaabblleess     Flush the tables.
             --FF oossffpp       Flush the passive operating system fingerprints.
             --FF aallll        Flush all of the above.

     --ff _f_i_l_e
             Load the rules contained in _f_i_l_e.  This _f_i_l_e may contain macros,
             tables, options, and normalization, queueing, translation, and
             filtering rules.  With the exception of macros and tables, the
             statements must appear in that order. Use of this option, could
             result in flushing of rules present in the main ruleset added by
             the system at startup. See /etc/pf.conf for further details.

     --gg      Include output helpful for debugging.

     --hh      Help.

     --ii _i_n_t_e_r_f_a_c_e
             Restrict the operation to the given _i_n_t_e_r_f_a_c_e.

     --KK _h_o_s_t | _n_e_t_w_o_r_k
             Kill all of the source tracking entries originating from the
             specified _h_o_s_t or _n_e_t_w_o_r_k.  A second --KK _h_o_s_t or --KK _n_e_t_w_o_r_k option
             may be specified, which will kill all the source tracking entries
             from the first host/network to the second.

     --kk _h_o_s_t | _n_e_t_w_o_r_k
             Kill all of the state entries originating from the specified _h_o_s_t
             or _n_e_t_w_o_r_k.  A second --kk _h_o_s_t or --kk _n_e_t_w_o_r_k option may be speci-
             fied, which will kill all the state entries from the first
             host/network to the second.  For example, to kill all of the
             state entries originating from ``host'':

                   # pfctl -k host

             To kill all of the state entries from ``host1'' to ``host2'':

                   # pfctl -k host1 -k host2

             To kill all states originating from 192.168.1.0/24 to
             172.16.0.0/16:

                   # pfctl -k 192.168.1.0/24 -k 172.16.0.0/16

             A network prefix length of 0 can be used as a wildcard.  To kill
             all states with the target ``host2'':

                   # pfctl -k 0.0.0.0/0 -k host2

     --mm      Merge in explicitly given options without resetting those which
             are omitted.  Allows single options to be modified without dis-
             turbing the others:

                   # echo "set loginterface fxp0" | pfctl -mf -

     --MM      Enable port to name translation while displaying rule.

     --NN      Load only the NAT rules present in the rule file.  Other rules
             and options are ignored.

     --nn      Do not actually load rules, just parse them.

     --OO      Load only the options present in the rule file.  Other rules and
             options are ignored.

     --oo _l_e_v_e_l
             Control the ruleset optimizer, overriding any rule file settings.

             --oo nnoonnee       Disable the ruleset optimizer.
             --oo bbaassiicc      Enable basic ruleset optimizations.  This is the
                           default behaviour.
             --oo pprrooffiillee    Enable basic ruleset optimizations with profiling.
             For further information on the ruleset optimizer, see pf.conf(5).

     --pp _d_e_v_i_c_e
             Use the device file _d_e_v_i_c_e instead of the default _/_d_e_v_/_p_f.

     --qq      Only print errors and warnings.

     --RR      Load only the filter rules present in the rule file.  Other rules
             and options are ignored.

     --rr      Perform reverse DNS lookups on states when displaying them.

     --ss _m_o_d_i_f_i_e_r
             Show the filter parameters specified by _m_o_d_i_f_i_e_r (may be abbrevi-
             ated):

             --ss nnaatt         Show the currently loaded NAT rules.
             --ss qquueeuuee       Show the currently loaded queue rules.  When used
                            together with --vv, per-queue statistics are also
                            shown.  When used together with --vv --vv, ppffccttll will
                            loop and show updated queue statistics every five
                            seconds, including measured bandwidth and packets
                            per second.
             --ss rruulleess       Show the currently loaded filter rules.  When used
                            together with --vv, the per-rule statistics (number
                            of evaluations, packets and bytes) are also shown.
                            Note that the ``skip step'' optimization done
                            automatically by the kernel will skip evaluation
                            of rules where possible.  Packets passed state-
                            fully are counted in the rule that created the
                            state (even though the rule isn't evaluated more
                            than once for the entire connection).
             --ss AAnncchhoorrss     Show the currently loaded anchors directly
                            attached to the main ruleset.  If --aa _a_n_c_h_o_r is
                            specified as well, the anchors loaded directly
                            below the given _a_n_c_h_o_r are shown instead.  If --vv
                            is specified, all anchors attached under the tar-
                            get anchor will be displayed recursively.
             --ss ssttaatteess      Show the contents of the state table.
             --ss SSoouurrcceess     Show the contents of the source tracking table.
             --ss iinnffoo        Show filter information (statistics and counters).
                            When used together with --vv, source tracking sta-
                            tistics are also shown.
             --ss RReeffeerreenncceess  Show pf-enable reference statistics (pid/name of
                            enabler, token, timestamp).
             --ss llaabbeellss      Show per-rule statistics (label, evaluations,
                            packets total, bytes total, packets in, bytes in,
                            packets out, bytes out) of filter rules with
                            labels, useful for accounting.
             --ss ttiimmeeoouuttss    Show the current global timeouts.
             --ss mmeemmoorryy      Show the current pool memory hard limits.
             --ss TTaabblleess      Show the list of tables.
             --ss oossffpp        Show the list of operating system fingerprints.
             --ss IInntteerrffaacceess  Show the list of interfaces and interface drivers
                            available to PF.  When used together with --vv, it
                            additionally lists which interfaces have skip
                            rules activated.  When used together with --vvvv,
                            interface statistics are also shown.  --ii can be
                            used to select an interface or a group of inter-
                            faces.
             --ss aallll         Show all of the above, except for the lists of
                            interfaces and operating system fingerprints.

     --TT _c_o_m_m_a_n_d [_a_d_d_r_e_s_s _._._.]
             Specify the _c_o_m_m_a_n_d (may be abbreviated) to apply to the table.
             Commands include:

             --TT kkiillll       Kill a table.
             --TT fflluusshh      Flush all addresses of a table.
             --TT aadddd        Add one or more addresses in a table.  Automati-
                           cally create a nonexisting table.
             --TT ddeelleettee     Delete one or more addresses from a table.
             --TT eexxppiirree _n_u_m_b_e_r
                           Delete addresses which had their statistics cleared
                           more than _n_u_m_b_e_r seconds ago.  For entries which
                           have never had their statistics cleared, _n_u_m_b_e_r
                           refers to the time they were added to the table.
             --TT rreeppllaaccee    Replace the addresses of the table.  Automatically
                           create a nonexisting table.
             --TT sshhooww       Show the content (addresses) of a table.
             --TT tteesstt       Test if the given addresses match a table.
             --TT zzeerroo       Clear all the statistics of a table.
             --TT llooaadd       Load only the table definitions from pf.conf(5).
                           This is used in conjunction with the --ff flag, as
                           in:

                                 # pfctl -Tl -f pf.conf

             For the aadddd, ddeelleettee, rreeppllaaccee, and tteesstt commands, the list of
             addresses can be specified either directly on the command line
             and/or in an unformatted text file, using the --ff flag.  Comments
             starting with a `#' are allowed in the text file.  With these
             commands, the --vv flag can also be used once or twice, in which
             case ppffccttll will print the detailed result of the operation for
             each individual address, prefixed by one of the following let-
             ters:

             A    The address/network has been added.
             C    The address/network has been changed (negated).
             D    The address/network has been deleted.
             M    The address matches (tteesstt operation only).
             X    The address/network is duplicated and therefore ignored.
             Y    The address/network cannot be added/deleted due to conflict-
                  ing `!' attributes.
             Z    The address/network has been cleared (statistics).

             Each table maintains a set of counters that can be retrieved
             using the --vv flag of ppffccttll.  For example, the following commands
             define a wide open firewall which will keep track of packets
             going to or coming from the OpenBSD FTP server.  The following
             commands configure the firewall and send 10 pings to the FTP
             server:

                   # printf "table <test> { ftp.openbsd.org }\n \
                       pass out to <test>\n" | pfctl -f-
                   # ping -qc10 ftp.openbsd.org

             We can now use the table sshhooww command to output, for each address
             and packet direction, the number of packets and bytes that are
             being passed or blocked by rules referencing the table.  The time
             at which the current accounting started is also shown with the
             ``Cleared'' line.

                   # pfctl -t test -vTshow

                       In/Block:    [ Packets: 0        Bytes: 0        ]
                       In/Pass:     [ Packets: 10       Bytes: 840      ]
                       Out/Block:   [ Packets: 0        Bytes: 0        ]
                       Out/Pass:    [ Packets: 10       Bytes: 840      ]

             Similarly, it is possible to view global information about the
             tables by using the --vv modifier twice and the --ss TTaabblleess command.
             This will display the number of addresses on each table, the num-
             ber of rules which reference the table, and the global packet
             statistics for the whole table:

                   # pfctl -vvsTables
                   --a-r-  test
                       Addresses:   1
                       Cleared:     Thu Feb 13 18:55:18 2003
                       References:  [ Anchors: 0        Rules: 1        ]
                       Evaluations: [ NoMatch: 3496     Match: 1        ]
                       In/Block:    [ Packets: 0        Bytes: 0        ]
                       In/Pass:     [ Packets: 10       Bytes: 840      ]
                       In/XPass:    [ Packets: 0        Bytes: 0        ]
                       Out/Block:   [ Packets: 0        Bytes: 0        ]
                       Out/Pass:    [ Packets: 10       Bytes: 840      ]
                       Out/XPass:   [ Packets: 0        Bytes: 0        ]

             As we can see here, only one packet - the initial ping request -
             matched the table, but all packets passing as the result of the
             state are correctly accounted for.  Reloading the table(s) or
             ruleset will not affect packet accounting in any way.  The two
             ``XPass'' counters are incremented instead of the ``Pass'' coun-
             ters when a ``stateful'' packet is passed but doesn't match the
             table anymore.  This will happen in our example if someone
             flushes the table while the ping(8) command is running.

             When used with a single --vv, ppffccttll will only display the first
             line containing the table flags and name.  The flags are defined
             as follows:

             c    For constant tables, which cannot be altered outside
                  pf.conf(5).
             p    For persistent tables, which don't get automatically killed
                  when no rules refer to them.
             a    For tables which are part of the _a_c_t_i_v_e tableset.  Tables
                  without this flag do not really exist, cannot contain
                  addresses, and are only listed if the --gg flag is given.
             i    For tables which are part of the _i_n_a_c_t_i_v_e tableset.  This
                  flag can only be witnessed briefly during the loading of
                  pf.conf(5).
             r    For tables which are referenced (used) by rules.
             h    This flag is set when a table in the main ruleset is hidden
                  by one or more tables of the same name from anchors attached
                  below it.

     --tt _t_a_b_l_e
             Specify the name of the table.

     --vv      Produce more verbose output.  A second use of --vv will produce
             even more verbose output including ruleset warnings.  See the
             previous section for its effect on table commands.  A third use
             of --vv will produce additional queue statistics related informa-
             tion.

     --ww _w_a_i_t
             Show queue statistics at intervals of _w_a_i_t seconds.

     --xx _l_e_v_e_l
             Set the debug _l_e_v_e_l (may be abbreviated) to one of the following:

             --xx nnoonnee       Don't generate debug messages.
             --xx uurrggeenntt     Generate debug messages only for serious errors.
             --xx mmiisscc       Generate debug messages for various errors.
             --xx lloouudd       Generate debug messages for common conditions.

     --zz      Clear per-rule statistics.

FFIILLEESS
     /etc/pf.conf  Packet filter rules file.
     /etc/pf.os    Passive operating system fingerprint database.
