Notes, evidence, text, errata, references, and todos from my 2014 paper Inside Mac Security

Abstract
-------

Mac OS X includes many unique security technologies ranging from the Keyring system, integrated Kerberos, application and network firewalls, code signing, anti-malware and exploitation resistance technologies, and Internet client application security to many commands (client and server) specific to Macintosh systems that support the security systems including those for certificate management, firewall configuration, drive imaging and encryption. We introduce the Mac OS X security systems and discuss the built-in tools with deliberate focus on the system utilities and command line tools used by security professionals.
